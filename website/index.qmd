## Introduction

The Washington Nationals is a professional baseball team that competes in Major League Baseball (MLB). Located in Washington, D.C., the team plays its home games at Nationals Park. Back in 2019, the Washington Nationals made a surprising run in the playoffs, culminating in a victory at the World Series and securing their first MLB championship in franchise history. Let's relive that exciting experience in the following video.

After years affected by COVID and several rebuilding seasons, the Washington Nationals have become a mediocre team within five years. They are consistently ranked as one of the bottom teams in their conference. What has changed during this period? The goal of this project is to use interactive visualization tools along with informative narratives to help the audience understand some team-level changes using a data-driven approach.

Our team has investigated various operational, offensive, and defensive statistics for the Washington Nationals and conducted extensive side-by-side comparisons to explore the differences or changes between 2019 and 2023. The final results are described in the 'Project Summary' tab, where the audience can view a detailed proposal for this project. The objective of this project is to use data visualization tools to tell a compelling story to the audience, relating to team management improvement strategies that could potentially elevate the Washington Nationals back to championship contention.
